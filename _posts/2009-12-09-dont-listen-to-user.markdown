<p>“The first rule of research is don’t listen to users. Instead, observe their behavior.”</p>

<p>The talk titled "Perfectly executing the wrong plan" at Google’s I/O conference is a must-watch talk by Tomer Sharon, Google Search User Experience Researcher. Especially if you're creating a new product, for fun or for profit.</p>

<p>Sharon explains why nobody is using your app. He points to a recent study of U.K.’s public toilets in gas stations, in which 99% of people claimed to have washed their hands after doing their business. But when electronic devices was installed on the faucets, it turned out that only 32% of men and 64% of women actually did wash their hands. “Some people would say, they’re just liars. They’re not,” Sharon says. “We are having trouble predicting our behavior. Humans are very bad at predicting the future."</p>

  <p>"It is shocking to see how much effort app developers put in writing elegantly structured, refactored code, with good unit test coverage in an agile environment, and yet, their apps fail miserably."</p>
