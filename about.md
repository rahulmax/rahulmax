I'm Rahul M. Hareendran, an User Experience and Interface Designer with a strong Front-endEngineering background from Kerala, India. <a href="http://twitter.com/rahulmax" title="@rahulmax">@rahulmax</a> is my twitter handle and you can find <a href="/assets/resume_rahul.pdf" title="Download Rahul's Résumé" target="_blank">my résumé here.</a>

When I'm not working, I can be seen with a camera clicking <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/7991565@N06/" title="Rahul's Flickr Page">landscape in HDR</a> or assisting <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Memory-lane/281426831999283" title="Memory Lane Photography">my wife's wedding photography</a>. I love designing, calligraphy and listenting to Rock music from the classic era.

By the way, this website is built using Jekyll and is hosted on Github. As if it wasn't easy to figure out.
