<p>I'm Rahul M. Hareendran, a User Experience and Interface Designer with a strong Front-end Engineering background, from the beautiful coastlines of Kerala, India. <a href="http://twitter.com/rahulmax" title="@rahulmax">@rahulmax</a> is my twitter handle and you can find <a href="/assets/resume_rahul.pdf" title="Download Rahul's Résumé" target="_blank">my résumé here.</a></p><br>

<p>When I'm not working, I can be seen with a camera clicking <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/7991565@N06/" title="Rahul's Flickr Page">landscape in HDR</a> or assisting <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Memory-lane/281426831999283" title="Memory Lane Photography">my wife's Photography</a>. I love designing, calligraphy and listenting to rock music from the classic era.</p><br>

<p>By the way, this website is built using Jekyll and is hosted on Github. As if it wasn't easy to figure out! :P</p><br>
