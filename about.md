  <p>I'm Rahul M. Hareendran, a User Experience and Interface Designer with a strong Front-end Engineering background, from the beautiful coastlines of Kerala, India. <a href="http://twitter.com/rahulmax" title="@rahulmax">@rahulmax</a> is my twitter handle and you can find <a href="/assets/resume_rahul.pdf" title="Download Rahul's Résumé" target="_blank">my résumé here.</a> and a few of my <a href="http://behance.net/rahulmax" title="Rahul's Behance Portfolio — Design and UI work" target="_blank">Design and UI work here</a></p>

  <p>I've been tinkering with everyday things since I was a kid and I take particular interest in fixing things that aren't broken.</p>

  <p>When I'm not working, I click <a href="http://rimisen.in/about" title="Rimi Sen Photography" target="_blank">weddings</a>  with my wife. I love designing, calligraphy, and listening to outrun/synthwave and rock from the classic era. Science and humans fascinate me.</p>
