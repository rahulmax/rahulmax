I'm Rahul M. Hareendran, User Experience Designer located in Bangalore, working at Bang The Table. This is the place where I share my thoughts and ideas.

When I'm not working, I can be seen with a camera assisting my wife's photography.

By the way, this website is built using Jekyll and is hosted on Github. As if it wasn't easy to figure out.
