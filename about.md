I'm Rahul M. Hareendran, User Experience Designer located in Bangalore, working at Bang The Table. This is the place where I share my thoughts and ideas. @rahulmax is my twitter handle and you can download <a href="/assets/resume_rahul.pdf" title="" target="_blank">my resume here.</a>

When I'm not working, I can be seen with a camera assisting my wife's photography.

By the way, this website is built using Jekyll and is hosted on Github. As if it wasn't easy to figure out.
